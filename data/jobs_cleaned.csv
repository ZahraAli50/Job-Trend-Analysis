Engineering (Data Products),Mutiny,"New York, NY","Company Overview

Most marketing teams can’t play a meaningful role in breaking through to target accounts because the 1:1 marketing strategies that work don’t scale, and what scales doesn’t work.

Mutiny helps B2B companies generate pipeline and revenue from their target accounts through AI-powered research, personalized experiences, and account intelligence.

Our customers are some of the fastest growing companies in the B2B space including Snowflake, 6sense, Writer, Segment, and Qualtrics. We are backed by Sequoia Capital, Insight Partners, and YCombinator.

About the role:

We’re looking for a high-impact software engineer who enjoys working at the intersection of applied AI and product experiences to drive key customer outcomes. This role will focus on our Data Layer — owning high scale data ingestion and analytics pipelines, LLM research processes that search public and private data sources for unique signals on target accounts, and our synthesis layer that helps marketing and sales teams understand what’s most important to their prospects. All of these components ladder up into a product experience that our customers use daily for a source of truth on their most important target accounts.

This is a unique opportunity to join a well-funded company, work on critical new projects using the latest and greatest in AI, and own products that drive real enterprise value. You will report directly to the CTO, lead projects and technical implementation for new product initiatives, and be an early hire in our newly opened office in NYC as we expand our team. And you’ll have a ton of fun while doing it!

What you’ll do:
• Build across the stack to help best-in-class B2B companies scale their growth.
• Collaborate with design and product to build AI-powered features that drive real customer value.
• Build scalable and resilient systems on top of the inherently non-deterministic nature of LLMs.
• Build a world class team of AI engineers to tackle a huge opportunity.
• Help set direction for Mutiny’s data and AI strategy.

What you bring:
• 5+ years of experience in software engineering
• Proficiency in a backend language like Python, TypeScript, Kotlin, or Ruby.
• You have an understanding of Data Science and comfortable with manipulating/cleaning/normalizing data.
• You have a “full-stack” mindset — you can be autonomous in implementing features e2e which helps you design features that deliver customer value.
• You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time.
• You love to collaborate with engineers across the spectrum of seniority and experiences.
• Someone who is energized by ambiguity and can create structure in a dynamic, fast-paced environment.
• Familiarity with LLM techniques (RAG, vector databases, LangChain, agent frameworks) is a plus.

What you’ll get out of it:
• You will create a name for yourself by getting to work with and support some of the fastest-growing companies in B2B SaaS.
• You will get exposure to real business problems every company faces (growth) that you can take with you to start your own company (or to help scale another).
• You will work directly with our founders and leaders to deliver product outcomes that have substantial impact on company trajectory.
• You will build an in person office in NYC as we scale headcount this year, being a critical voice in hiring and carrying our culture.
• You will have fun, plain and simple. There is a reason our first company value is that work should feel like play.",['python']
